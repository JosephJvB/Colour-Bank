# Front-End, Back-End, React-Hyperscript.

Quick project to brush up on sqlite3 database with Knex, GET and PUT routes.
Also another chance to play with react-hyperscript.

```Clone > Install > knex migrate:latest > knex seed:run > npm run dev```

Click on the numbers to increment the number by +1. Click reset to set back to 0.
Values are saved in a database so refreshing the browser does not reset the number values.

TODOS: Add and remove colours rather than having 4 hard coded. Also include some wild-card feature :)
